/**
 * The linted_io_write_all function repeatedly writes to fd until of
 * buf is written or an error occurs (except for EINTR).
 *
 * For example, a bit could be written and then fd could be closed and
 * an error would be returned but some bytes would still have been
 * written.
 *
 * @param ko The kernel object to be written to.
 *
 * @param bytes_wrote The amount written. Is set to no larger than
 *                    count bytes and at least zero bytes. If NULL
 *                    then is not set.
 *
 * @param buf The buffer to be written from. Must be at least count bytes
 *            long.
 *
 * @param count The amount to write. No more than these many bytes is
 *              written.
 *
 * @returns Zero on success or an error code.
 *
 * @error EAGAIN The file descriptor has been marked nonblocking and
 *               one of the writes would block.
 *
 * @error EBADF ko is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for
 *              writing.
 *
 * @error EWOULDBLOCK Means the same as EAGAIN but may be a different
 *                    value.
 *
 * @error EFAULT buf is not accessible.
 *
 * @error EINVAL ko is not writable or the file was opened with
 *               O_DIRECT and alignment restrictions weren't
 *               satisfied.
 *
 * @error EIO I/O error.
 *
 * @error ENOSPC No room for the data.
 *
 * @error EPIPE ko is a pipe or socket with a closed read end.
 *
 * @error EISDIR ko is a directory.
