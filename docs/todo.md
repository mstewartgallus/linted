Linted -- TODO

* Integrate this documentation with Doxygen
* Port to --host=i686-w64-mingw32

    * As part of this process environment sanitization code will need
      to be reworked. Windows maintains two copies of environment
      variables: one copy in process space and the other copy in
      kernel space.

* Ban assert in favour of `LINTED_IMPOSSIBLE_ERROR`

    assert has problems with not evaluating arguments.

* Separate out into many different executables

    Our solution is far too painful already and breaks ASLR.

* Port to SDL 2.0
* Manage child process error streams and syslog logs
* Make a hang check timer

    This timer will periodically make sure tasks are reaching their
    deadlines by sending a message to every message queue and seeing
    if the owner of the queue responds within appropriate
    deadlines. It will then kill and restart the process if it is not
    responding.

* Monitor vulnerabilities in dependencies and supported platforms
* Think about whether to use -Wa,--noexecstack and -Wl,-z,noexecstack

    I think I read somewhere that these force a nonexecutable stack
    but that if things are done correctly that the shouldn't be
    happening anyways. I believe what I really want is a
    -Wl,--warn-execstack option.

* Make spawner forks check passed in sockets

    Because the spawner forks off processes the current protocol isn't
    so bad but there should be a little error checking.

* Don't do cargo cult security

    This is pretty much impossible.

    I'm just a young hacker playing around with technologies like
    sandboxing. I have no real knowledge of security. I hope this
    project is useful as a personal learning experience though.

* Don't do security theater

    Security theater is when people do big and impressive things with
    sandboxing but then conveniently forget a back door that lets
    attackers in.

    See Don't do cargo cult security for why this is impossible.
