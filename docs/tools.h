 * <li> Linux Dwarves tools
 *
 * - dwarves
 *   - codiff       Diffs changes in binaries
 *   - dtagnames    Lists tag names
 *   - pahole       Finds holes in structures
 *   - pdwtags      Dwarf information pretty printer
 *   - pfunct       Displays information about functions
 *   - pglobal      Displays information about global variables
 *   - prefcnt      Tries to find unreferenced tags
 *
 * These tools would be extremely useful if they worked on a wider
 * range of types. So far, they all seem to break and not handle any
 * structure types that aren't extremely ordinary.
