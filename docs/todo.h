 * Linted -- TODO
 *
 * @bug If window is moved partially offscreen and resized it fails to
 *      draw to a part of the window opposite from the part offscreen
 *      (not my bug works with glxgears too.)
 *
 * @bug Intermittently restarting a process fails and a new process is
 *      not spawned successfully and `ptrace(PTRACE_SEIZE)`; fails
 *      with `EPERM`.
 *
 * @todo Fix collision handling. I want to prevent interpenetration
 *       and properly handle discontinuities in velocity. I need
 *       proper collision response and not the hacky spring like thing
 *       I have currently.

 *
 * @todo Add platform specific information and defines to static
 *       analysis tooling.
 *
 * @todo Eventually reduce `-Wstack-usage` to 500.
 *
 * @todo Port to --host=i685-linux-gnu
 * - This works well except that I can't test the drawer because EGL
 *   and GLES don't work well with multilib.
 *
 * @todo Port to --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
 *
 * @todo Use length annotated strings instead of C strings.
 *
 * @todo Create a notification method.
 *       Currently, outside administrator can create requests to the
 *       monitor system but there needs to be a way for the monitor to
 *       generate notifications. User Mode Linux has the same problem
 *       and we should learn from how they solve it.
 *
 * @todo Stop graphical banding problems
 *
 * @todo Preserve socket files between restarts
 * @todo Make the window notifier use Unix domain sockets
 *       - The window notifier needs to act as a broadcaster
 *       - The window tasks cannot currently use bind mounts
 * @todo Once Unix domain sockets are used completely switch over to
 *       unconnected and unreliable sockets.
 * @todo Make the window notifier use Unix domain sockets
 * @todo Make tasks that connect to Unix sockets unable to delete them
 *
 * @todo Harden bind mounts with extra flags
 *
 * @todo Eventually reduce `-Wstack-usage` to 500.
 *
 * @todo Check child processes for hangups
 *
 * @todo Use the monitor to report crashes such as from seccomp rule
 *       violations.
 *
 * @todo Create a feed of possible vulnerabilities in all dependencies
