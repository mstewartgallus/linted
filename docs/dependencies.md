Potentially Vulnerable Runtime Dependencies
===========================================

*   glLoadGenerator - https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/glloadgen/

    glLoadGenerator is both a build and a runtime dependency as it
    generates code to be used.

*   Linux - https://www.kernel.org/

*   The GNU C Library - https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/

    There are a few race conditions and bugs in glibc so we need to be
    careful.

*   The GNU Compiler Collection - https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/
*   The GNU Binary Utilities - https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/
