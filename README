                              **IMPORTANT WARNING**
================================================================================

**This project is still in early development. It is very broken and
not at all secure. As well, the developer is not the smartest and
isn't very well educated in security. For your safety you should not
derive code or algorithms from it.**

Some of these methods of guarding against software bugs include:

- process isolation
  - by forking and executing new processes
  - we guard against inheriting corrupted state by
    - execveing new process images from binaries
    - sanitizing unclosed file descriptors at process startup
- toolchain hardening options
- linters and static analysis tools

We plan on also guarding against bugs with:

- operating system level process sandboxing
  - operating system resource limits
  - operating system capabilities
- formal analysis tools
- a formalized model of IPC using
  - temporal logic tools to prove theorems about various safety and
    liveness properties
- extensive testing with
  - unit tests
  - fuzz tests
