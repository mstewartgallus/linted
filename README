methods of guarding against software bugs.

                              **IMPORTANT WARNING**
================================================================================

**Because this project is still in early development it is very broken
and not at all secure. It is inadvisable to directly take code or
algorithms from it. Nonetheless you may find it has a few interesting
ideas.**

Some of these methods of guarding against software bugs include:

- process isolation
  - by forking off new processes
  - using a fork server started from a known good state which
    - protects against accidental inheritance of corrupted state
- toolchain hardening options including
  - the GNU linker options for
    - marking global symbols readonly after they are resolved with -z,relro
    - resolving symbols immediately with -z,now
    - marking the stack not executable with -z,noexecstack
  - the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) options for
    - stack smashing protection with -fstack-protector-all
    - signed overflow protection with -ftrapv
      - this can lead to denial of service attacks but sudden exit was
        judged better than incorrect behaviour in this case
    - position independent executable support with -pie and -fPIE
- linters including:
  - Clang's static analysis
  - Cppcheck

We plan on also guarding against bugs with:

- operating system level sandboxing of process
  - resource limits with setrlimit
  - capabilities using seccomp
- static analysis tools including:
  - Frama C
  - CBMC
- a formalized system of IPC using
  - temporal logic tools to prove theorems about various safety and
  liveness properties
- safe functions and easy to use functions such as
  - not strerror (it's not thread safe)
- extensive testing with
  - unit tests
  - fuzz tests
  - under tools such as
    - Valgrind
    - electric fence or duma
