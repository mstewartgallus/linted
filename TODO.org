Linted -- TODO

* Port to --host=i686-w64-mingw32
* Allow multiple file descriptors to be sent over to a new task
This will let us move the simulator to message queues
* Move the gui to message queue style
* Fix bug where the spawner can't close because it keeps a handle to itself
* Move more completely to use syslog
* Make servers hand out the connection file descriptors not clients
The current way is inherently fragile and insecure.
* Remove libuv
It gets in the way
* Don't do cargo cult security
This is pretty much impossible.

I'm just a young hacker playing around with technologies like
sandboxing. I have no real knowledge of security. I hope this project
is useful as a personal learning experience though.
