Linted --- TODO

* Sandbox the gui
This process currently uses poll and so can't be sandboxed easily.
* Sandbox all processes more effectively
There are a few more options to explore in setrlimit.
Also there are better options than setrlimit.
* Move away from instant failure
It's bad style to have library calls that terminate the applicaton.
* Understand CBMC complaints
It seems to complain about nonsense.
* Use a better system of IPC
The current system is kind of hacky.
* Formalize our IPC
We should be able to use temporal logic tools to formalize our message
passing and create theorems about various safety and liveness
properties.
