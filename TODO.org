Linted --- TODO

* Sandbox the gui
This process currently uses poll and so can't be sandboxed easily.
* Sandbox all processes more effectively
There are a few more options to explore in setrlimit.
Also there are better options than setrlimit.
We should use seccomp and etc...
* Move away from instant failure
It's bad style to have library calls that terminate the applicaton.
* Don't use strerror
It's not thread safe.
* Understand CBMC complaints
It seems to complain about nonsense.
* Use a better system of IPC
The current system is kind of hacky.
* Formalize our IPC
We should be able to use temporal logic tools to formalize our message
passing and create theorems about various safety and liveness
properties.
* Port to --host=i686-w64-mingw32
* Use unit testing
Unit tests should probable run under Valgrind, or duma, or electric
fence.
