Linted -- TODO

* Port to --host=i686-w64-mingw32
* Allow multiple file descriptors to be sent over to a new task
This will let us move the simulator to message queues
* Move the gui to message queue style
* Think about whether to use -Wa,--noexecstack and -Wl,-z,noexecstack
I think I read somewhere that these force a nonexecutable stack but
that if things are done correctly that the shouldn't be happening
anyways. I believe what I really want is a -Wl,--warn-execstack
option.
* Fix bug where the spawner can't close because it keeps a handle to itself
* Make servers hand out the connection file descriptors not clients
The current way is inherently fragile and insecure.
* Remove libuv
It gets in the way
* Don't do cargo cult security
This is pretty much impossible.

I'm just a young hacker playing around with technologies like
sandboxing. I have no real knowledge of security. I hope this project
is useful as a personal learning experience though.
