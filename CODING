This is a list of rules for code quality and style in Linted. The
rules for code style are very arbitrary but must be followed for
overall code consistency although they can bent sometimes. The rules
for code quality are not arbitrary and must be always followed.

Code quality:

- Understand but do not slavishly follow the CERT C coding standards
  (as of 2014-02-15 available at
  https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/CERT+C+Coding+Standard
  ).

Coding style:

- Use the Linux kernel coding style but with an indent level of 4 and
  no tabs.

- Use %i instead of %d in format specifiers.
