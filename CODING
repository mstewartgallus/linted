This is a list of rules for code quality and style in Linted. The
rules for code style are very arbitrary but must be followed for
overall code consistency although they can bent sometimes. The rules
for code quality are not arbitrary and must be always followed.

Code quality:

- Understand but do not slavishly follow the CERT C coding standards
  (as of 2014-02-15 available at
  https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/CERT+C+Coding+Standard
  ).

- Do not leak data through structure padding. When one copies data
  from structures using mq_send, write or any other function as if
  they are byte arrays one can leak data. See CERT rule DCL39-C. Avoid
  information leakage in structure padding (as of 2014-02-15 available
  at
  https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/DCL39-C.+Avoid+information+leakage+in+structure+padding
  ).

Coding style:

- Use the Linux kernel coding style but with an indent level of 4 and
  no tabs.

- Use %i instead of %d in format specifiers.
