This is a list of rules for code quality and style in Linted. The
rules for code style are very arbitrary but must be followed for
overall code consistency although they can bent sometimes. The rules
for code quality are not arbitrary and must be always followed.

Code quality:

- Understand but do not slavishly follow the CERT C coding standards
  (as of 2014-02-15 available at
  https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/CERT+C+Coding+Standard
  ).

- Do not leak data through structure padding.

  When one copies data from structures using mq_send, write or any
  other function as if they are byte arrays one can leak data. See
  CERT rule DCL39-C. Avoid information leakage in structure padding
  (as of 2014-02-15 available at
  https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/DCL39-C.+Avoid+information+leakage+in+structure+padding
  ).

- Maintain compatibility with all supported targets

  For example, names ending in _t are reserved by POSIX and should not
  be defined in code that should be POSIX compatible (although code
  reimplementing POSIX functionality should probable define _t ending
  names to names of replacement types).

Coding style:

- We have 3 types of errors and one type of failure.

  - First we have function failure which is an error. Functions can
    fail for legitimate reasons. Functions that fail usually return -1
    and set a reason in errno.

  - We have LINTED_FATAL_ERROR for errors that must terminate the
    process. They exit and return an error code to the controller of
    the process.

  - We have LINTED_IMPOSSIBLE_ERROR for fundamental errors such as
    programmer logic errors and memory corruption. These are
    assertions that abort the process. This is preferred over assert
    because it gives more information (it also doesn't have the side
    effect problems of it).

  - We have LINTED_LAZY_DEV_ERROR for error cases that the developer
    is too lazy to properly handle at the moment. These should never
    appear in release builds.

- Use the Linux kernel coding style but with an indent level of 4 and
  no tabs.

- Use %i instead of %d in format specifiers.
